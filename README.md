# alx-low_level programming

I started my programming jorny with lovel programing such as **c** and **bash**
in this rip i learned about everthing in **C** the mother of all programming language.
and this is a step bt step gued of how i learned **low level programming**

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies and related to Low level programming concepts


ALL projects was completed as part of the curriculum for the ALX-SE programme which is based on the curriculem of [holbertonshool](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) best in the silcon vally. ALX Africa is an online full-stack software engineering program that prepares students for careers in the tech industry using project-based peer learning.

| Project | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world) | Introduction to C programming. Covers setting up the environment, writing the first C programs, and understanding basic concepts such as compilation, syntax, and the use of `printf` for output. |
| [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while) | Introduction to variables, data types, operators, control flow with `if`, `else` statements, and loops (`while`, `for`). Focuses on how to use these constructs to control the flow of a program. |
| [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops) | Explores functions, their definitions, and calls. Introduces nested loops and their applications. Emphasizes the importance of modularity and code reuse through functions. |
| [0x03. C - Debugging](./0x03-debugging) | Techniques and tools for debugging C programs. Covers common bugs, how to use a debugger (like `gdb`), and strategies for identifying and fixing errors in code. |
| [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) | Advanced use of functions and nested loops. Explores more complex problems and solutions, reinforcing the concepts of abstraction and iterative processes. |
| [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays, and strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) | Introduction to pointers, arrays, and strings. Covers pointer arithmetic, array manipulation, and string handling functions. Essential for understanding dynamic memory and efficient data manipulation. |
| [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays, and strings](./0x06-more_pointers_arrays_strings) | Further exploration of pointers, arrays, and strings. Delves into multidimensional arrays, dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`, and more complex string operations. |
| [0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays, and strings](./0x07-even_more_pointers_arrays_strings) | Advanced concepts in pointers, arrays, and strings. Includes topics like pointer-to-pointer, array of pointers, and more sophisticated string manipulation techniques. |
| [0x08. C - Recursion](./0x08-recursion) | Introduction to recursion, a fundamental programming concept where functions call themselves. Covers base cases, recursive cases, and practical examples like factorial and Fibonacci series. |
| [0x09. C - Static libraries](./0x09-static_libraries) | Understanding static libraries in C. Covers creation, usage, and linking of static libraries. Emphasizes the benefits of code reuse and modularity. |
| [0x0A. C - argc, argv](./0x0A-argc_argv) | Command-line arguments in C. Explains how to use `argc` and `argv` to handle inputs from the command line and how to parse and process these arguments within programs. |
| [0x0B. C - malloc, free](./0x0B-malloc_free) | Dynamic memory allocation in C. Covers the use of `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` for managing memory at runtime. Highlights best practices and common pitfalls. |
| [0x0C. C - More malloc, free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free) | Advanced dynamic memory management. Explores complex data structures like linked lists and trees that require dynamic allocation, and techniques for avoiding memory leaks and corruption. |
| [0x0D. C - Preprocessor](./0x0D-preprocessor) | Understanding the C preprocessor. Covers macros, header files, conditional compilation, and other preprocessor directives that help in code management and optimization. |
| [0x0E. C - Structures, typedef](./0x0E-structures_typedef) | Introduction to structures and `typedef` in C. Explains how to define and use structures to create complex data types and how `typedef` can simplify code readability and maintenance. |
| [0x0F. C - Function pointers](./0x0F-function_pointers) | Using pointers to functions. Covers how to declare, define, and use function pointers, and their applications in callbacks and event-driven programming. |
| [0x10. C - Variadic functions](./0x10-variadic_functions) | Functions that accept a variable number of arguments. Explains how to use `stdarg.h` to create functions like `printf` that can handle a varying number of inputs. |
| [0x12. C - Singly linked lists](./0x12-singly_linked_lists) | Introduction to sigly liked list and. 
| [0x13. C - More singly linked lists](./0x13-more_singly_linked_lists) | Further exploration of singly linked lists. Covers more complex operations and manipulations, such as inserting and deleting nodes at various positions, and reversing lists. |
| [0x14. C - Bit manipulation](./0x14-bit_manipulation) | Understanding bitwise operations in C. Covers operators like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT, as well as bit shifts and their practical applications in tasks like setting, clearing, and toggling bits. |
| [0x15. C - File I/O](./0x15-file_io) | Introduction to file input and output in C. Explains how to open, read, write, and close files using standard library functions. Covers topics such as file pointers, binary files, and error handling in file operations. |
| [0x17. C - Doubly linked lists](./0x17-doubly_linked_lists) | Introduction to doubly linked lists. Covers the structure and implementation of doubly linked lists, including operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal in both directions. |
| [0x18. C - Dynamic libraries](./0x18-dynamic_libraries) | Understanding dynamic libraries in C. Covers creation, usage, and linking of dynamic libraries (`.so` files). Emphasizes the benefits of shared code and runtime linking. |
| [0x1A. C - Hash tables](./0x1A-hash_tables) | Introduction to hash tables. Covers the concepts of hashing, hash functions, collision resolution techniques, and the implementation of hash tables for efficient data retrieval. |
